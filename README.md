# Word Analytics App
### by ByteGrad

This is a project that I made following ByteGrad course about CSS, HTML5 and JS.
Where I thought it made sense I tried to personalize the code.

This tought me basic CSS styling, creating a simple layout in HTML and add logic to the page with JS.
Compared to the Count project I got to use basic programming logic, to update the word/char counts; another difference is that I had to work with a text field instead of listening for click events (simple counter project)
